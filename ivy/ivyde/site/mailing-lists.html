Before posting to mailing lists, make sure you don't have the answer to your question in the [[faq]] or more generally in the [[history/latest-milestone/index documentation]].

Actually there is no IvyDE specific mailing lists. Every discussion about IvyDE is part of the Ivy mailing lists. So if you have any question about the use of IvyDE, use ivy-user@ant.apche.org. About the development use dev@ant.apache.org. And to get the subversion and Jira notifications, subscribe to notifications@ant.apache.org.

For further information about these mailing lists, see [[../mailing-lists Ivy mailing list page]].</textarea>
