With each version of Apache Ivy, you can find:
<h2>binary distribution</h2>

<h2>binary distribution with dependencies</h2>
Containing jars, dependencies, documentation and examples.
This version is well suited if you want to easily use Apache Ivy with all its optional tasks relying on external dependencies, without having to download them later. It requires at least a jre 1.4+ to run, and it can be used with Ant 1.6.2 or later.
<h2>sources</h2>
