<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
The groovy frontend is about bringing Groovy into Ant, so you can write your
build file in Groovy rather than in XML. The language change so the build files are
less overloaded of useless characters. The build file structure is kept very
similar to the XML one. So the learning of that new language is pretty straight
forward, the translation of an XML build file into a groovy one is quite simple.
</p>

<p>
Actually, behind the hood you will write XML, but the 
<a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Creating+XML+using+Groovy%27s+MarkupBuilder">Groovy way</a>.
And we will get all the benefit of a scripting language as Groovy. Just to mention
at least one feature: no more need of the ant contrib for the use of the if-then-else
structure, you will just use the Groovy one just like you would do in Java.
</p>

<h1>Hello world</h1>

<p>
Let's see throw a very simple example how easy is to write a Groovy build script.
So here is a simple hello world build file:
<pre>
project.name = 'hello-world-project'
project.basedir = '.'
project.defaultTarget = 'sayhello'

target(name: 'sayhello', description: 'Say hello to the world') {
  echo(message: 'Hello world !')
}
</pre>
Here is what it would have been written in XML:
<pre>
&lt;project name="myproject" basedir="." default="sayhello"&gt;

  &lt;target name="sayhello" description="Say hello to the world"&gt;
    &lt;echo message="Hello world !" /&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

&lt;/project&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>
As you can see a Groovy build script do not start with some root node. It is actually
just a simple Groovy script which has some predefined function
and variables and with which is associated an Ant project instance.
</p>
<p>
So as attached variable there is the Ant project, on which we set its name,
base directory and default target. And there is a special function (that doesn't
appear to be so but it is) "target" which will actually define a target. The
definition of the target take into parameter a name, it also accept a depends,
just like in XML.
</p>

<p>
In the target we are entering into the XML mode, where you write XML with the
<a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Creating+XML+using+Groovy%27s+MarkupBuilder">
Groovy MarkupBuilder</a>. In this mode a function call is interpreted as a XML
tag, the parameters of the function call the attributes of the XML tag, and the
closure (the brackets) the content (data and sub tags) of the XML tag.
</p>

<p>
And to run that script, nothing different from the classical XML build file
invokation. Just name your Groovy build file <tt>build.groovy</tt> file and launch
ant in the folder you put your file in:
<pre>
$ ls
build.groovy
$ ant -p
Buildfile: build.groovy

Main targets:

Other targets:

 sayhello  Say hello to the world
Default target: sayhello
$ ant
Buildfile: build.groovy

sayhello:
     [echo] Hello world !

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 0 seconds
</pre> 
</p>

<h1>Strings in Groovy</h1>

<p>
In Groovy there are two kinds of strings. Some are simple quoted which are just
basic Strings. Some are double quoted where Groovy is parsing and replacing
property values (usually called GString).
</p>

<p>
The ones with are double quoted are interpreted so that we can put variable in
place of tokens, like in XML build script. But the difference with XML is that
while the XML script find the variables in the Ant properties and the Ant
references, Groovy is searching in its own variable space. The Groovy frontend
of Ant is making the Ant properties and the Ant references available to Groovy.
So setting and getting variables in Groovy is settings and getting Ant property
and Ant references. The Groovy strings can be used as in the XML scripts. See:
<pre>
  property(name: 'myprop', value: 'myvalue')
  echo(message: "the value of myprop is: ${myprop}")
</pre>
But as the string is interpreted by Groovy, properties with dots cannot be
accessed. For instance this following piece of script will fail.
<pre>
  property(name: 'myprop.value', value: 'myvalue')
  echo(message: "the value of myprop is: ${myprop.value}") // myprop doesn't exist for Groovy
</pre>
In that case you should prefer using the Ant tokenizer by using simple string,
simple quoted:
<pre>
  property(name: 'myprop.value', value: 'myvalue')
  echo(message: 'the value of myprop is: ${myprop.value}')
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Escaping <code>$</code> is different in GString and in simple strings. In Ant (the
simple string), you will use <code>$$</code>. Whereas in Groovy you should use
<code>\$\$</code> (it is doubled because it will be also interpreted by Ant).
</p>

<p>
So it is <b>recommended to only use simple string</b>. And if you do want
to refer to local variables, then use GString or just use simple string
concatenation:
<pre>
  def localVar = 'foo'
  echo(message: "using GSTring to get localVar: ${localVar}")
  echo(message: 'using simple string concatenation to get localVar: ' + localVar)
</pre>
</p>

<h1>Groovy variables</h1>

<p>
As in every Groovy script, we can define local variables, variables local to the
environment they are being used. For instance we can do:
<pre>
  def myvar = 'foo'
  echo(message: "the value of myvar is: ${myvar}")
</pre>
</p>

<p>
There are also variables which are properties of the enclosing class. In the Groovy
frontend they are managed in a custom way. It tries to map these properties to
the Ant environment of properties and references. So when setting a Groovy you
will actually set an Ant property (which are immutable):
<pre>
  myprop = 'foo'
  myprop = 'bar'
  echo(message: 'the value of myprop will be foo: ${myprop}') 
</pre>
</p>

<p>
When trying to read a variable, the Groovy frontend search for
<ul>
<li>a corresponding Ant property. If none found it then search for</li>
<li>a corresponding Ant reference. If none found it then search for</li>
<li>a real Groovy property, like the predefined ones 'project'</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
When trying to set a value on a variable, the Groovy frontend will check that:
<ul>
<li>it doesn't try to modify the 'project' property</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Invoke a task</h1>

<p>
Invoking a task is pretty straight forward as soon as you know how to write it
in XML. Let's see some examples.
</p>

<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>In XML</th>
        <th>in Groovy</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A simple task with a simple attribute</td>
      <td><pre>
  &lt;touch file="temp.txt" /&gt;
</pre></td>
      <td><pre>
  touch(file: 'temp.txt')
</pre></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A task with some text as value</td>
      <td><pre>
  &lt;echo&gt;
    echoing some text
  &lt;/echo&gt;
</pre></td>
      <td><pre>
  echo('echoing some text')
</pre></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A task with an attribute and some text as value</td>
      <td><pre>
  &lt;echo file="log.txt"&gt;
    echoing some text
  &lt;/echo&gt;
</pre></td>
      <td><pre>
  echo(file: 'log.txt', 'echoing some text')
</pre></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A task with sub element</td>
      <td><pre>
  &lt;copy todir="${basedir}/target"&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir="${basedir}/src"&gt;
      &lt;exclude name="**/*.java" /&gt;
    &lt;/filset&gt;
  &lt;/copy&gt;
</pre></td>
      <td><pre>
  copy(todir: '${basedir}/target') {
    fileset(dir: '${basedir}/src') {
      exclude(name: '**/*.java')
    }
  }
</pre></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A task mixing text value and sub element</td>
      <td><pre>
  &lt;fail&gt;
    oups, it failed !
    &lt;condition&gt;
      &lt;not&gt;
        &lt;isset property="thisdoesnotexist"/&gt;
      &lt;/not&gt;
    &lt;/condition&gt;
  &lt;/fail&gt;
</pre></td>
      <td><pre>
  fail('oups, it failed !') {
    condition() {
      not() {
        isset(property: 'thisdoesnotexist')
      }
    }
  }
</pre></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h1>Task definition and namesapce</h1>

<p>
In Ant we can import new task and type definitions into a build script. These tasks
and types can get into the default namespace, or in a custom one.
</p>

<p>
When these types and tasks are defined in the default namespace, as in XML,
nothing particular to do to call the imported tasks. For instance in XML we write:
<pre>
&lt;project&gt;

  &lt;taskdef resource="org/apache/ivy/ant/antlib.xml" /&gt;

  &lt;target name="buildlist"&gt;
    &lt;buildlist reference="build-path" ivyfilepath="ivy/ivy.xml" reverse="true"&gt;
      &lt;fileset dir="projects" includes="**/build.xml"/&gt;
    &lt;/buildlist&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

&lt;/project&gt;
</pre>
In Groovy it is as simple:
<pre>
taskdef(resource: 'org/apache/ivy/ant/antlib.xml')

target(name: 'buildlist') {
  buildlist(reference: 'build-path', ivyfilepath: 'ivy/ivy.xml', reverse: 'true') {
    fileset(dir: 'projects', includes: '**/build.xml')
  }
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
If the tasks or types are defined in a custom namespace, then in XML we need to
define a XML namespace and the call of the imported tasks are in that XML namespace:
<pre>
&lt;project xmlns:ivy="org.apache.ivy.ant"&gt;

  &lt;taskdef resource="org/apache/ivy/ant/antlib.xml" uri="org.apache.ivy.ant" /&gt;

  &lt;target name="buildlist"&gt;
    &lt;ivy:buildlist reference="build-path" ivyfilepath="ivy/ivy.xml" reverse="true"&gt;
      &lt;fileset dir="projects" includes="**/build.xml"/&gt;
    &lt;/ivy:buildlist&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

&lt;/project&gt;
</pre>
In Groovy here is a pure Groovy way of playing with namespace:
<pre>
import groovy.xml.NamespaceBuilder

taskdef(resource: 'org/apache/ivy/ant/antlib.xml', uri: 'org.apache.ivy.ant')
def ns = NamespaceBuilder.newInstance([ 'ivy': 'org.apache.ivy.ant' ], project.references['groovyfront.builder'])

target(name: 'buildlist') {
  ns.'ivy:buildlist'(reference: 'build-path', ivyfilepath: 'ivy/ivy.xml', reverse: 'true') {
    fileset(dir: 'projects', includes: '**/build.xml')
  }
}
</pre>
The Groovy frontend of Ant is providing easier way of playing with them:
<pre>
taskdef(resource: 'org/apache/ivy/ant/antlib.xml', uri: 'org.apache.ivy.ant')
def ivy = groovyns(uri: 'org.apache.ivy.ant')

target(name: 'buildlist') {
  ivy.buildlist(reference: 'build-path', ivyfilepath: 'ivy/ivy.xml', reverse: 'true') {
    fileset(dir: 'projects', includes: '**/build.xml')
  }
}
</pre>
You can also specify a prefix to the groovyns so that in the log you don't get
the verbose uri log, just the prefix. Without the prefix you can get in the log
something like this:
<pre>
  [org.apache.ivy.ant:buildlist] ...
</pre>
If you specify a prefix this way:
<pre>
def ivy = groovyns(prefix: 'ivy', uri: 'org.apache.ivy.ant')
</pre>
Then you get in the log:
<pre>
  [ivy:buildlist] ...
</pre>
</p>

<h1>Import / Include</h1>

<p>
<code>import</code> being a keyword in Groovy, the <code>import</code> Ant task
has been renamed in the Grovvy frontend <code>include</code>. So
<code>include</code> is just a direct alias of <code>import</code>, the
functionality is exactly the same.
</p>

<p>
As this Groovy frontend is just a frontend above Ant, we can actually mix XML
build files with Groovy ones. Only the language is different.
</p>

<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>In XML</th>
        <th>in Groovy</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Import of a build.xml file</td>
      <td><pre>
  &lt;import file="common/build.xml" /&gt;
</pre></td>
      <td><pre>
  include(file: 'common/build.xml')
</pre></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Import of a build.groovy file</td>
      <td><pre>
  &lt;import file="common/build.groovy" /&gt;
</pre></td>
      <td><pre>
  include(file: 'common/build.groovy')
</pre></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h1>Bringing Groovy into Ant</h1>

<p>
As the script is expressed in the Groovy language, we can use some of the Groovy
language feature into our build script.
</p>

<h2>if-then-else</h2>

<p>
A very basic feature that doesn't exist in Ant is branching. Well, there
are some on targets (if, unless), and there are some in
<a href="http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/tasks/tasks/if.html">ant-contrib</a>,
but there are quite difficult or painful to write.
</p>

<p>
So here is the basic use case:
<pre>
target(name: 'default') {
  condition(property: 'fileExist', value: 'true', else: 'false') {
    available(file: 'file.txt')
  }
  if (fileExist) {
    echo('file.txt exists')
  } else {
    echo('file.txt was not found')
  }
}
</pre>
Note that the property has to be set for alternative value otherwise Groovy will
complain that is it looking up for a property that doesn't exist. If no
alternative value is provided, then the script should look like:
<pre>
target(name: 'default') {
  condition(property: 'fileExist') {
    available(file: 'file.txt')
  }
  if (project.properties['fileExist'] != null && fileExist) {
    echo('file.txt exists')
  } else {
    echo('file.txt was not found')
  }
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
You can even put an if-then-else structure in a task definition:
<pre>
target(name: 'default') {
  copy(todir: basedir) {
    fileset(dir: '${basedir}/target') {
      if (excludeJava) {
        exlude(name: '**/*.java')
      }
    }
  }
}
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Loops</h2>

<p>
<code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>do-while</code>
</p>

<h2>try-catch</h2>

<p>
TODO: should we document that ?
</p>

<h2>functions</h2>

<p>
In Groovy you can define function (closure with arguments). So we can define
function that call ant task, latter to be called in some target.
<pre>
def copyselected = { dir, todir, includes ->
  copy(todir: todir) {
    fileset(dir: dir) {
      include(name: includes)
    }
  }
}

target(name: 'copy-java') {
  copyselected('${basedir}/src', '${basedir}/target/sources', '**/*.java')  
}

target(name: 'copy-txt') {
  copyselected('${basedir}/src', '${basedir}/target/jar', '**/*.txt')  
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
But use these with caution, as local variables override ant tasks. If you
define a local variable that has the same name of an ant task, then you won't be
able to call the tasks. For instance this will fail:
<pre>
def echo = 3
echo(message: 'calling this task will fail')
</pre>
</p>

<h1>Crappy code allowed by Groovy</h1>

<p>
Properties can be set everywhere Groovy allow variable setting. And properties
are global to the entire script while standard Groovy property are only affected
to the local closure. This can be confusing. This kind of code should be avoided:
<pre>
target(name: 'set-prop') {
  copy(todir: basedir) {
    fileset(dir: '${basedir}/target') {
      excludePattern = '**/*.java'
      exlude(name: '${excludePattern}')
    }
  }
}
</pre>
And we should prefer the folowing code that does exactly the same as above:
<pre>
target(name: 'set-prop') {
  excludePattern = '**/*.java'
  copy(todir: basedir) {
    fileset(dir: '${basedir}/target') {
      exlude(name: '${excludePattern}')
    }
  }
}
</pre>
</p>

</body>
