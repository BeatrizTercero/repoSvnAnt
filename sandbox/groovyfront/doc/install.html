<h1>Install the GroovyFront into an Ant installation</h1>

<p>Actually you just need to make the groovyfront.jar and its dependences
available in the classpath of Ant when it starts. It has to be added the same
way the Ant's optional dependencies have to be added: see in the
<a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html#optionalTasks">Ant manual</a>
how to install an optional task.
</p>

<h2>The jars to be installed in Ant:</h2>
<ul>
<li>GroovyFront which you should have <a href="build.html">build</a>: ant-groovyfront.jar</li>
<li>Groovy 1.7.0:
<a href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/codehaus/groovy/groovy/1.7.0/groovy-1.7.0.jar">groovy-1.7.0.jar</a>
</li>
<li>ASM 3.2:
