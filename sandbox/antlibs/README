Adding New Antlibs to the Sandbox

To add a new antlib to the Sandbox, you should perform the following steps
1. Use svn mkdir to create the antlib directory
2. Use svn mkdir to add the trunk, branches and tags directories.

This gives the antlib the correct SVN dir layout. Once you have committed
the basic antlib layout, you should add the antlib trunk to the externals
definition in the all-trunks directory. You can use

svn pe svn:externals .

in the all-trunks directory. The dormat of the file should be evident from 
the existing entries.
