What we need for release 1.0:

* Unit tests
* Support for alternative workflow that requires no index file, 
  and uses numbered patch files instead 
  (such workflow targets smaller projects with less commit concurrency).
* Support for arbitrary patch tracking table schema for better portability.
* Support for patch file update detection and optional re-run (confirmed interactively).
  This would allow to test partial patches, undo them manually and rerun again.
* Support for multi-DB patches, with support for default patches that fit all DB's, and minimal required overrides.
