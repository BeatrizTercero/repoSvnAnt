I created these files using "reverseengeneering" of Ant.

I went through all error message reported by Eclipse, created the classes and
created the methods and fields manually or via Eclipse Quick-Fix.

I had to use two different source folders "src" and "src2" because there are
"com.*" classes and a "COM.*" class.
