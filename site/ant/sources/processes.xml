      Here we describe some of the processes we use.

  <section name="Retire a subproject or component">
    <p>
      The process starts by a format vote by the Ant PMC 
      on the main development mailinglist.
      Basically we have to announce it and make resources read-only.

    <subsection name="Retire: Version Control">
      <p>
        Most of our source code is in git, only "site" and "sandbox" use subversion.
        We place a marker RETIRED_PROJECT file on the top level. <br/>
        Add a note at the top of a README file as well so it is immediately visible 
        to people browsing the github mirror. Include a link to this page for
        a possible future reactivation and a link to the vote result. <br/>  
        Ask infra to make the repository read-only.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Retire: Issue Tracker">
      <p>
        If the subproject/component has its own issue tracker we have to close that.
        It is enough to make it read-only, so these information are longer available.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Retire: Mailing List">
      <p>
        If the subproject/component has its own mailing list we have to close 
        this. We should send a final email.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Retire: Announcement">
      <p>
        We have to announce the retirement of the subproject at dev@ant, 
        announce@apache and the Ant main page.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Retire: Build Jobs">
      <p>
        All build jobs on Jenkins@Apache, TeamCity and Gump have to be deleted.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Retire: Homepage">
      <p>
        Add the retirement to the archive-page.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Retire: Releases">
      <p>
        The last released artifacts, if any, should be removed from the Apache 
        distribution server. To do so, remove any artifact related to the retired 
        subproject in <a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/ant/">https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/ant/</a>
        (it is managed with subversion). 
        Note: as every Apache release, nothing is deleted but everything is archived, 
        the artifacts will still be available at <a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/">https://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/</a>
        (or <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/">http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/</a>
        for Incubator releases).
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Retire: Free Further Resources">
      <p>
        Maybe a subproject locks further resources (update-site, ...). 
        So we have to unblock them.   
      </p>
    </subsection>
  </section>



  <section name="Reactivate a subproject or component">
    <p>
      The process starts by a format vote by the Ant PMC 
      on the main development mailinglist.
      Basically we have to announce it and make resources read-write again.

    <subsection name="Reactivate: Version Control">
      <p>
        Delete the marker file "RETIRED_PROJECT". <br/> 
        Delete the note at the top of a README file as well so it is immediately 
        visible to people browsing the github mirror. <br/>  
        Ask infra to make the repository read-write again.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Reactivate: Issue Tracker">
      <p>
        If the subproject/component has its own issue tracker we have to reopen that.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Reactivate: Mailing List">
      <p>
        Because reopeing implies a smaller community we should use the main mailinglist
        dev@ant. So reactivating a special list is not required and could be postponed
        to a later PMC decision.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Reactivate: Announcement">
      <p>
        Announce the reactivation of the subproject at dev@ant.
        Decide about announcing the reactivation of the subproject at announce@apache.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Reactivate: Build Jobs">
      <p>
        New build jobs on Jenkins@Apache, TeamCity and Gump could be created as
        required. 
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Reactivate: Homepage">
      <p>
        Remove the component from the archive-page.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Reactivate: Releases">
      <p>
        All earlier releases are available at <a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/">https://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/</a>.
        We don't have to copy them back to <a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/ant/">https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/ant/</a>.
        But further releases are placed here. 
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Reactivate: Free Further Resources">
      <p>
        Make existing read-only resources read-write again.
        Further resources could be gained as required. 
      </p>
