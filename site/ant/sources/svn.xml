    <section name="Access the Source Tree (Subversion)">

      <p>Anyone can checkout source code from our public Subversion repository. To do so,
         simply use the following command (if you are using a GUI client, configure it
         appropriately):</p>

      <source>
svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/[project]/trunk/ ant-[project]</source>

      <p>Modules available for access are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/ant/sandbox/">sandbox</a> - New developments. Contains currently gendoc.<br/>
            http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/sandbox/
        </li>

      href="http://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html">Apache Software Foundation's
      source repositories page</a> may hold many helpful hints.</p>

            <p>A nice view of the source history is available through
