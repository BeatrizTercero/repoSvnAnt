      <h3>Apache EasyAnt</h3>
      
      <p>Apache EasyAnt is a toolbox focusing on easing project build processes. 
      It's based on <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Apache Ant</a> and 
      <a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/">Apache Ivy</a>, and allows for maximum 
      flexibily, improved integration in existing build systems and provides 
      conventions and guidelines.</p>
      
      <p>The goals are :
      <ul>
          <li>to leverage popularity and flexibility of Ant.</li>
          <li>to integrate Apache Ivy, such that the build system combines a ready-to-use dependency manager.</li>
          <li>to simplify standard build types, such as building web applications, JARs etc, by providing ready to use builds.</li>
          <li>to provide conventions and guidelines.</li>
          <li>to make plugging-in of fresh functionalities as easy as writing Ant scripts.</li>
      </ul>
      To still remain adaptable, 
      <ul>
          <li>Though EasyAnt comes with a lot of conventions, we never lock you in.</li>
          <li>EasyAnt allows you to easily extend existing modules or create and use your own modules.</li>
          <li>EasyAnt makes migration from Ant very simple. Your legacy Ant scripts could still be leveraged using EasyAnt.</li>
      </ul>
