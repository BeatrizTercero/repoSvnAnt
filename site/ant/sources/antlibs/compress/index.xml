      <p>The Apache Compress Antlib contains tasks and resources that
        provide compression/uncompression and archival/unarchival
        capabilities based
        on <a href="http://commons.apache.org/compress/">Apache
        Commons Compress</a>.</p>

      <h3>April 20, 2012 - Apache Compress Ant Library 1.2
      Available</h3>

      <p>Apache Compress Ant Library 1.2 is now available for
      download as <a
      href="http://ant.apache.org/antlibs/bindownload.cgi">binary</a>
      or <a
      href="http://ant.apache.org/antlibs/srcdownload.cgi">source</a>
      release.</p>
    </section>

    <section name="Introduction">
      <p>Using Apache Commons Compress this Antlib supports gzip, xz,
        pack200 and bzip2 compression and ar, cpio, tar, Unix dump and
        zip archives.  Support for the dump format is read-only.</p>

      <p>The current code base is based on the 1.4 release of Commons
        Compress but it is expected that this Antlib follows Commons
        Compress' development and will add new compression or
        archiving formats as they are provided by the underlying
        library.</p>

      <p>The gzip and bzip2 tasks and resources are similar to the
        corresponding tasks and types in Ant's core and mainly just
        use a different code base for the implementation of the
        formats.</p>

      <p>The same is mostly true for the zip and tar resources as well
        as the unzip/tar task with some major differences:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>unzip and zipfileset can work with non-File resources.</li>
        <li>All zip resources and tasks support Zip64 extensions
        i.e. they can deal with large entries, large archives or archives
        with many files that Ant's core resources/tasks can not
        handle.</li>
        <li>untar and tarfileset transparently support POSIX/PAX
        extension headers used by modern tar implementations for long
        file names or big file sizes - as well as star's extension for
        large file sizes used by star and GNU tar.</li>
        <li>The tar task can use PAX extension headers for long file
        names or big file sizes or star's extension.  Archives created
        with the POSIX format will be readable by GNU tar but also by
        all modern native tar implementations.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The zip and tar tasks are completely new implementations and
      offer a superset of the functionality of the core tasks.</p>

      <p>Tasks and resources for the ar, dump and cpio formats mirror
        those available for tar and zip.  Those for pack200 and xz mirror
        those of gzip and bzip2.</p>

      <p>All tasks and types can be mixed with the core tasks and
        types; it is possible to use the core zip task to create an
        archive based on an cpiofileset for example.</p>

      <p>As of version 1.2, the Compress Antlib requires Java 5 or higher.</p>
