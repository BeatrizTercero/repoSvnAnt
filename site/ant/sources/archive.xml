      <p>
        Here we list all archived subprojects or components as described in
        <a href="processes.html">processes</a>. If required there is also
        defined how to reactivate them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about an archived subproject, feel free
        to ask on the Ant user mailinglist users@ant.a.o. Most of the resources
        are further read-only available.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: as every Apache release, nothing is deleted but everything is 
        archived, the artifacts will still be available at 
        <a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/">https://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/</a>
        (or <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/">http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/</a>
        for Incubator releases).
