<h1>Easyant on IRC (#easyant on freenode)</h1>
We've registered an <a href="http://www.irchelp.org/">IRC</a> channel on the <a href="http://www.freenode.net/">freenode</a> network for informal easyant discussions, asking questions or just hanging out and "socializing".

The channel is <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/easyant">#easyant on irc.freenode.net</a>.

Drop by if you are interested in the development of easyant, have a quick question or just want to get to know the people developing and using it. If you're new to IRC, be sure to learn <a href="http://www.mikeash.com/getting_answers.html">how to get answers</a>. A free web irc client is available <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">here</a>.</textarea>
